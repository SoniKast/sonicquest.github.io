			<h2>What is the game's story?</h2>
			<p>The game takes place on Emerald Island, which is a convex island, hidden underneath Angel Island. 
			Legends say that the Island is the origin of the Echidna Tribe, the Master Emerald and the Chaos Emeralds; 
			it also possesses other powerful gems. Robotnik detects an energy source from this Island, and obtains the 
			Discord Stone and harnesses its power into his newest machine: The Steampunk Egg. Sonic and Tails catch wind
			of his plans, and decide to go and stop his nefarious plans before he gets a chance to destroy the whole planet!</p>
