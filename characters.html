    <h2>Heroes and Villains</h2>
    <h2>Sonic The Hedgehog</h2>
	<p>All spikes and speed, Sonic the Hedgehog is the fastest hedgehog in the world-</^> 
	<p>big on attitude and with a big heart to match.</p>
	<p>Like the wind, he's always on the move, living a life of excitement and adventure.</p>

	<h2>Miles "Tails" Prower</h2>
    <p>A talented young fox cub, Tails can fly by spinning his two tails like heli-copter rotors.</p> 
	<p>A gentle soul bullied in his past for having two tails,</p>
	<p>Tails became more confident about himself after meeting Sonic and seeing him run like the wind.</p> 
	<p>Tails looks up to Sonic and has been with him ever since.</p>

	<h2>Knuckles The Echidna</h2>
    <p>Knuckles is a heroic and powerful echidna who lives on Angel Island, an island in the sky.</p>
	<p>He guards the island's giant Master Emerald.</p>
	<p>He's Sonic's rival and friend who can be snarky and witty with his traps</p> 
	<p>but he tends to be quick to trust others, which makes him sometimes very gullible.</p>
	<p>In this game, he has his own story, seperate from the others.</p>

	<h2>Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik</h2>
    <p>Sonic, Tails and Knuckles's main enemy.</p>
	<p>Not much is known about this man, other than that he is a scientist,
	<p>And he wishes to take over the planet and build his Eggman empire.</p> 
	<p>He makes his inventions from his base on South Island,</p>
	<p>where he powers his robots with small animals known as Flickies,</p>
	<p>which are the animals Sonic and his friends save.</p>
