			<h2>Miles "Tails" Prower</h2>

			A gentle soul bullied in his past for having two tails, Tails became more confident about himself
			after meeting Sonic and seeing him run like the wind. Tails looks up to Sonic and has been
			with him ever since.</p>

			<h2>Knuckles The Echidna</h2>
			<p>Knuckles is a heroic and powerful echidna who lives on Angel Island, an island in the sky.
			He guards the island's giant Master Emerald. He's Sonic's rival and friend who can be snarky
			and witty with his traps, but he tends to be quick to trust others, which makes him sometimes 
			very gullible. In this game, he has his own story, seperate from the others.</p>

			inventions from his base on South Island, where he powers his robots with small animals known as
			Flickies, which are the animals Sonic and his friends save.</p>
